<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida. My research interests are in the areas of database systems, and high performance computing on GPU. I got a MS in computer Engineering from University of South Florida and BS in Computer Engineering from Mahidol University.</p>

<h3> Algorithms for Computing 2-body Statistics on GPUs (2015-2018) </h3> 
<p> Various types of two-body statistics (2-BS) are regarded as essen- tial components of low-level data analysis in scientific database systems. In relational algebraic terms, a 2-BS is essentially a Cartesian product between two datasets (or two instances of the same dataset) followed by a user-defined aggregate. The quadratic complexity of these computations hinders timely pro- cessing of data. Use of modern parallel hardware has thus become an obvious solution to meet such challenges. This paper presents our recent work on de- signing and optimizing parallel algorithms for 2-BS computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Although a typical 2-BS problem can be summa- rized into a straightforward parallel computing pattern, traditional knowledge from (general) parallel computing often falls short in delivering the best pos- sible performance. Therefore, we present a suite of techniques to decompose 2-BS problems and methods for effective use of computing resources on GPUs. We also develop analytical models that guide us towards finding the best pa- rameters of our GPU programs. As a result, we achieve the design of highly- optimized 2-BS algorithms that significantly outperform the best known GPU and CPU implementations. Although 2-BS problems share the same core com- putations, each 2-BS problem however carries its own characteristics that calls for different strategies in code optimization. For that, we develop a software framework that automatically generates high-performance GPU code based on a few parameters and short primer code input. We further present two case studies to demonstrate that code generated by this framework reaches a very high level of efficiency.</p>

<h3> Study the access pattern of tuples/pages in a database system (2014) </h3> 
<p> Database management system (DBMS) manages a huge amount of data, and in the course of processing the requiredspace for the blocks of data will often be greater than the memory space available. For this there is the need to manage a memory in which to load and unload the blocks. The buffer manager is responsible primarily for managing the operations. In this project we modified the POSTGRESQL code to track the frequency by which each tuple or page is accessed by the DBMS. Tracking the frequency of each page or tuple helps in using buffer more efficiently. For example if we want to place data items of similar popularities together, this project helps managing the buffer efficiently.</p>

<h3>Parallel Keyword Searching utilizing a GPU for Network Forensics (2012)</h3> 
<p> Nowadays, there is an increasing number of cybercrime on the Internet. Governments, businesses and individuals are in great risk. In order to trace back to criminals, lawful interception may be required. However, it is a complex and computation intensive task. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can offer highly parallel computing power with great performance at a low cost to such a task. This paper; therefore, focus on using a GPU for keyword searching in network traffic. The KMP skip searching algorithm was selected as the experimental string searching algorithm. Various parameters of the GPU were also investigated to obtain the optimal value for this application.</p>
